My website is [ehan.dev](https://ehan.dev), this repository has its source code :3

[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ehanahamed/site) Â· [GitHub](https://github.com/ehanahamed/site)

Some of my projects, like [EhUI](https://ehan.dev/ehui), are under ehan.dev, like [ehan.dev/ehui](https://ehan.dev/ehui)

Those projects have a copy of the project's website's files included in this repository, but those projects' real source code and website's source code are in its own repository.

Some of my other really epic projects, like [Quizfreely](https://quizfreely.com) have their own domain (like [quizfreely.com](https://quizfreely.com)).
