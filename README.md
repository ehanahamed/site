My website is [ehan.dev](https://ehan.dev), this repository has its source code :3

[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ehanahamed/site) Â· [GitHub](https://github.com/ehanahamed/site)

Some of my projects, like [EhUI](https://ehan.dev/ehui), are under ehan.dev, like [ehan.dev/ehui](https://ehan.dev/ehui)

This repository includes copies of those projects' websites' files, but those projects' actual source code and their website's source code are in each project's own seperate repository.

Some of my other, really epic, projects have their own domain, like [quizfreely.com](https://quizfreely.com)
