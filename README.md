This repository has the source code of my website, [ehan.dev](https://ehan.dev) :3

[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ehanahamed/site) Â· [GitHub](https://github.com/ehanahamed/site)

Some of my projects, like [EhUI](https://ehan.dev/ehui), have their website under ehan.dev, like [ehan.dev/ehui](https://ehan.dev/ehui)

This repository includes those projects' websites' files, but those projects' actual source code and their site's source code are in each project's own, seperate, repository.

Some of my other, really epic, projects have their own domains, like [quizfreely.org](https://quizfreely.org)
